# TrafficSimulation

1. Introduction
The traffic problem I experienced in the city building game Cities: Skylines inspired me. In my
project, I simulated 3 different road patterns with paid passages with 3 different models. I
have observed the performance of the queue in the passages and the difference between
the number of cars entering and leaving according to the arrangement of the roads.

2. Modeling Part
As I mentioned in the Introduction section, I use 3 different models with different road
patterns with paid passages. There are 3 reasons why I work with 3 models instead of a
single model:
a. Inclusion of the lengths of the roads in the model
b. To examine the effects of passages by increasing the number of passes and thus the
number of queues, not the performance of a single paid passage with a single queue
by increasing the number of resources
c. To extend the scope of the project

For more informations, there is a report.
